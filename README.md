### JavaScriptExpenseTracker

While learning The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert, I thought it would only be fitting to build out my own version of the activities to implement what I have leant, and plcae it into a project that can be tracked and stored on Github.

This will be a three phrase project:

phase 1: building the web interface with javascript features
phase 2: implementing a database connection
phase 3: implementing a framework


April 2022 - phase 1 is in development

2. visibility of summarized income, expense and balance.
3. add + track expenses.
4. add + track income.
5. ability to delete acccount.
