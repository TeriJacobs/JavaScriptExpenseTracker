## JavaScriptExpenseTracker

While learning <i>The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert</i>, I thought it would only be fitting to build out my own version of the tasked activities to implement what I have learnt, and place it into a project that can be tracked and stored on Github.

This will be a four phrase project:

<ul>
  <li>phase 1: building the web interface with javascript features</li>
  <li>phase 2: mobile responsive</li>
  <li>phase 3: implementing a database connection</li>
  <li>phase 4: implementing a frontend framework</li>
</ul>


April 2022 - phase 1 is in development

The functionality consists of:

1. login and logout.
2. visibility of summarised income, expense and balance.
3. add + track expenses.
4. add + track income.
5. ability to delete account(s).

#### This application is built to showcase my understanding of pure javascript, alongside the ability to implement Bootstrap styling and planning (using Github projects and Figma).
